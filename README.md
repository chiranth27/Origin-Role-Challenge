# Origin-Role-Challenge
Repository that contains 3 tasks that were completed by me during the role challenge by Origin health
Task 1: Anonymizing Patient Medical Reports and Generating JSON Files
Objective: Extract and anonymize sensitive patient information from 50 medical reports.
Key Actions:
Extract patient IDs, gestational age, patient age, BMI, and examination findings.
Anonymize sensitive information such as:
Patient name
Patient ID
Hospital name
Clinicians' names
Generate a JSON file with the extracted and anonymized data.
Outcome: Learn data extraction, transformation, and anonymization processes while adhering to data privacy standards.

Task 2: DICOM Extraction and Visualization
Objective: Extract metadata from DICOM files containing CT brain images and categorize it.
Key Actions:
Extract metadata into three categories:
Patient-related
Image-related
Machine-related
Visualize the metadata and the images.
Create collages for a clear presentation of the findings..
Outcome: Gain expertise in handling medical image metadata, categorization, and visualization.

Task 3:DICOM Image extraction and feature extraction pipeline
Objective:
To process unlabelled DICOM images, extract features, and group them using clustering techniques for analysis.

Key Actions:
Extract images from DICOM files.
Build a feature extraction pipeline (e.g., edge detection, deep learning).
Apply clustering algorithms to segregate images.
Present results visually and document the process.
Outcome:
Organized image clusters based on extracted features.
Code showcasing computer vision and clustering skills.
Clear instructions to replicate the process.
